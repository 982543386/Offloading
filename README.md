# Offloading
My personal TFG repository

This project contains the code of the simulator I created for my bachelor thesis: "Remote/Local offloading of mobile applications as an energy saving strategy". Offloading is a cutting-edge technology eager to reduce the battery consumption of mobile terminals. Regarding the daily and constant usage of our mobile devices, and despite the improvements in batteries manufacturing, this technique could become a solution as long as the expansion of cloud services. The aim is to offload the data processing to the cloud in order to reduce the computation of the mobile terminal and dispatch it to the cloud. Here's when it is created an interesting scenario with several users who are desiring to offload their data processing to the cloud, using several access points that will access to remotes virtual machines.

As it will be seen, this repository creates an scenario with all the resources needed to connect to these access points and remote virtual machines as well as the management of the whole environment.
